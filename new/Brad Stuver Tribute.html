            <h3>Entering MLS</h3>
            <p>After his senior season of college, Stuver was invited to the
                2013 MLS Combine. He was the only Horizon
                League player selected to the combine, and was one of seven
                collegiate goalkeepers to earn a spot. On
                January 17, 2013 Stuver was drafted in the second round (32nd
                overall) of the 2013 MLS SuperDraft by
                Montreal Impact. He was the first goalkeeper chosen in the
                draft. The Impacted declined to sign Stuver,
                so he was signed by the MLS as a pool goalkeeper for the 2013
                season. </p>
            <p>On December 1, 2017, Crew SC declined Stuver's contract option,
                ending his four-year tenure with the
                club. During his time in Columbus, Stuver made seven appearances
                for Crew SC in official competition. He
                appeared just twice in league play.</p>

                Austin community by organizing the
                "Laundry Project", an effort that helps Austin families by
                covering expenses at laundromats around the
                city. Brad was recently recognized by the MLS as one of the
                finalists for Humanitarian of the year.</p>
